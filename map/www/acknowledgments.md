# Acknowledgements

This map and the backing dataset was built and compiled by the [Parking Reform Network](https://parkingreform.org/) with the help of many generous individuals.

## Concept and Initial Report Data

This project is based on [A Map of Cities That Got Rid of Parking Minimums](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2015/11/18/a-map-of-cities-that-got-rid-of-parking-minimums) intially published by [StrongTowns](https://strongtowns.org) in November 2015. Reports have been submitted by many StrongTowns readers over the years and reporters are, generally, credited on the city detailed information pages.
