4. Public Parking Credit. Any site within 600 feet of a public parking area may reduce the required vehicle parking at a rate of one space for every two public parking spaces.

"1062","Oregon","OR","US","In July 2022, Oregon's Land Conservation and Development Committee adopted permanent rules which will require 61 cities in the state's 8 metro regions to eliminate parking mandates near high frequency transit service by 1/1/2023. Additional rules will require more comprehensive reforms in following years. 

HB2001, passed in 2019,  legalized “missing middle” housing types – such as duplexes, fourplexes, and townhomes – in medium and large cities statewide. The new rules implementing the law “hold mandatory parking ratios at or below one parking space per home.”

HB2001 rules apply to any city with a population greater than 10,000 people and to any city in a metro area with more than 1,000 people. Approximately 58 Oregon cities fall under this definition.

Medium cities had to comply by 6/30/2021 and Large cities must comply by 6/30/2022.

Additionally, ADUs are legal, statewide, and cities may not require parking for ADUs.","Passed","Eliminate Parking Minimums, Reduce Parking Minimums","Regional, Transit Oriented","All Uses","Patrick Siegman","May 19, 2022","July 25, 2022 at 10:05:40 AM PDT",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4028977,"false","false","https://parkingreform.org/mandates-map/city_detail/Oregon_OR.html",43.521,-120.587,"OregonORUS","Regional","TOD","city",1,"Oregon, OR","not_special_icon"

Previous California laws limited local parking mandates. 

Senate Bill 35, adopted in 2017, has streamlined the approval of thousands of affordable homes near transit. The law grants these projects relief from local parking mandates.

Senate Bill 9 signed into law in 2021, makes it legal statewide to build up to four homes on most lots that are currently zoned for single-family homes only.
