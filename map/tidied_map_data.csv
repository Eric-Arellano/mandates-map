"126","Greenville","SC","US","In 2009-2010, the City of Greenville, SC worked with Upstate Forever, a local non-profit organization that works to promote sensible growth and protect special places in Upstate SC, to conduct a study of some of the City’s off-street parking requirements for commercial properties. The study ultimately showed that there was an excess of available parking (up to 65%) during times of peak use, and as a result, the City revised 10 of its requirements to reflect the actual parking demand. Additionally, the City worked with Upstate Forever to create a fee-in-lieu program that requires developers who install more than the minimum requirement of parking spaces to either pay a fee for each additional space (to be used for stormwater management) or install LID to treat the stormwater runoff created as a result. -Erika Hollis","Unverified","","","","Erika Hollis",1068464,0,34.851354,-82.3984882,"GreenvilleSCUS","red","car",1,59,96,"not_special_icon"
