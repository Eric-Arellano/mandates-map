		        <h3>Summary</h3>
		        <p>The City of Clearwater has eliminated parking minimums for the majority of uses in its Downtown this year. We did keep for residential, but reduced the requirement for attached dwellings (down to 1 space/unit instead of 2, also allowing tandem parking for those that provide more than the min which wasn't previously allowed). We still require 2/unit for detached (single-fam) residential units. Also, we maintained a requirement for two other uses - overnight accommodations but it is 0.75 spaces/room and for educational facilities (secondary education) because we don't have a robust transit system yet, and we have one currently in downtown that struggles to provide the parking it needs for its students. This was a big step for us.</p>
