		        <h3>Summary</h3>
		        <p>The City of Tacoma has a "Reduced Parking area" that encompasses most of the downtown core area, and effectively requires zero parking. Also all of the mixed use centers (which makes up the majority of all the new development in town) has low/no required parking. All in all there are still parking requirements, but they have been greatly reduced and there is support at the policy level to expand the reduced parking area. That said Tacoma has a large mix of single family neighborhoods and there are some bastions of support to require more rather than less parking, but that is being chipped away at by more transit (expanding light rail throughout the city, more bus and rapid bus routes, etc.).</p>
